1. The dataset `z` was loaded in the Google Colab notebook.
2. The mean (μ) of the data was calculated using NumPy.
3. The variance (σ²) of the data was computed.
4. The parameter λ was estimated using the formula:
   
   λ = 1 / (2σ²)

5. The normalization constant `c` was calculated as:
   
   c = √(λ / π)

6. Using these parameters, the Gaussian probability density function was defined.
7. The estimated PDF was plotted over the range of the data using Matplotlib.

## Results
Mean (μ):25.8045  
Lambda (λ):0.00146026  
The probability density function graph obtained using the estimated parameters is plotted in the uploaded notebook (`.ipynb` file).
## Tools Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab  

## Conclusion
The Gaussian model was successfully fitted to the given dataset by estimating the required parameters. The resulting probability density function provides a smooth approximation of the data distribution.
